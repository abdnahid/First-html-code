	<h1>Hi I am Abdullah Al Nahid</h1>
	<p>
		I am an Engineer. I have completed my graduation recently in Mechanical engineering. Currently I am unemployed but taking preparation for a govt. job. I have always wanted to learn coding. In my university life i learned a bit of web design but couldnt be consistant. In this pandemic situation I think  its the best opportunity to learn and if possible become a full time freelancer. Hopefully i can achieve it.
	</p>
	<h3>What I learn</h3>
	<ol type="I">
		<li>html</li>
		<li>CSS</li>
		<li>javascript</li>
		<li>php</li>
